I'm Dylan Drake, a software developer working in research. I spend my days building tools that help people make sense of complex problems.

This blog is where I write about what I've observed—not just about code, but about the people and organizations that shape it. How teams communicate, why certain tools catch on and others don't, and what the structure of a codebase reveals about the humans who built it.

I'm particularly interested in the space between technical systems and human systems, and what happens when they meet.
